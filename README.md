## Description
This Python script checks the strength of a given password and estimates the time it would take to crack it. It provides feedback based on various criteria, such as length, character types, and complexity.

## Features
- Password length check
- Uppercase and lowercase character check
- Digit inclusion check
- Special character inclusion check
- Time estimation for brute force attacks

## Possible Improvements
- **Common Password Check:** Implement a check against a list of commonly used passwords to further enhance security.
- **Pattern Detection:** Explore methods to detect and penalize passwords with easily recognizable patterns or sequences.
- **Keyboard Patterns:** Add a check to identify and discourage passwords that follow common keyboard patterns, such as QWERTY sequences.
